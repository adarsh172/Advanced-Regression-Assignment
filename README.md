# Project Name
> Advanced Regression using Ridge and Lasso regression 


## Objective
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them at a higher price. The company wants to know:

-Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
-How well those variables describe the price of a house.
Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the American market.

## Conclusions
The optimal lambda value in case of Ridge and Lasso is as below:

Ridge - 0.2
Lasso - 10
The R Squared value in case of Ridge and Lasso are:

Ridge - 0.8493
Lasso - 0.8497

The RMSE value in case of Ridge and Lasso are:

Ridge - 862342848.7406102
Lasso - 1069309274.8658706

The R Squared Value of Lasso is slightly higher than that of Ridge

Also, since Lasso helps in feature reduction (as the coefficient value of one of the feature became 0), Lasso has a better edge over Ridge.

Hence based on Lasso, the factors that generally affect the price are the Zoning classification, Living area square feet, Overall quality and condition of the house, Foundation type of the house, Number of cars that can be accomodated in the garage, Total basement area in square feet and the Basement finished square feet area
